#  Reflexive Identity - Self-Defending AI Agent

> **Auth0 for AI Agents Challenge Submission**

An experimental AI security framework that treats AI agents as authenticated digital entities capable of self-verification, integrity monitoring, and autonomous privilege revocation.

##  Concept

Traditional AI agents execute commands without verifying their own operational integrity. **Reflexive Identity** introduces a zero-trust loop where agents:

1. **Authenticate themselves** via Auth0 before every action
2. **Calculate their own trust score** based on behavioral patterns
3. **Dynamically request or revoke privileges** when anomalies are detected
4. **Trigger an immune response** when integrity drops below threshold

##   Auth0 for AI Agents - Three Pillars Implementation

###  Pillar 1: Authentication
The agent authenticates itself using Auth0 client credentials flow.

###  Pillar 2: Token Vault
Secure scope management with cognitive justification for privilege escalation.

###  Pillar 3: Fine-Grained Authorization
Real-time scope verification with dynamic revocation based on trust score.

##   Why This Matters

**Current Problem**: AI agents are powerful but naive—they follow instructions without self-verification.

**Reflexive Identity Solution**: Agents that authenticate themselves, reason about their privileges, and self-limit when compromised.
